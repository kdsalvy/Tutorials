/**
 * JDOM provides a great Java XML API to read, edit and write XML documents
 * easily. JDOM provides wrapper classes to chose your underlying implementation
 * from SAX Parser, DOM Parser, STAX Event Parser and STAX Stream Parser.
 * Benefit of using JDOM is that you can switch from SAX to DOM to STAX Parser
 * easily, you can provide factory methods to let client application chose the
 * implementation.<br/>
 * <ul>
 * <b>Use Cases :</b>
 * <li>Read Xml</li>
 * <li>Write Xml</li>
 * <li>Edit Xml</li>
 * </ul>
