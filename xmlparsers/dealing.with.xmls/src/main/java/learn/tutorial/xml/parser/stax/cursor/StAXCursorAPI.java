/**
 * The cursor-based API allows the application to process XML as a stream of
 * tokens aka events; the application can check the parser’s state and get
 * information about the last parsed event, then advance to the next event, and
 * so on. This is a low-level API; while considerably efficient, it does not
 * provide an abstraction of the underlying XML structure.
