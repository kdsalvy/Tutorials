/**
 * Decorator design pattern is used to enhance the functionality of a particular
 * object at run-time or dynamically.
 * At the same time other instance of same class will not be affected by this so
 * individual object gets the new behaviour. Basically we wrap the original object
 * through decorator object. 
 * Decorator design pattern is based on abstract classes and we derive concrete
 * implementation from that classes
 * It’s a structural design pattern and most widely used.
